Unzip the submitted file2. Have the configuration file,java files,launcher script in the current working directory3. Run the launch script : sh launcher.sh [config file name] [netId]4. Run cleanup script to kill all the processes in the end or before running the program again : sh cleanup.sh [config file name][netId]Problem Statement:The project involves socket programming,you can only use machines dcXX.utdallas.edu, where XX ∈ {01, 02, .., 45}, for running the program.Although you may develop the project on any platform, I run on dc.xx machines in colleges.1Project DescriptionThis project consists of three parts.1.1Part 1Implement a distributed system consisting of n nodes, numbered 0 to n − 1, arranged in a certaintopology. The topology and information about other parameters will be provided in a configurationfile.All channels in the system are bidirectional, reliable and satisfy the first-in-first-out (FIFO)property. You can implement a channel using a reliable socket connection (with TCP or SCTP).For each channel, the socket connection should be created at the beginning of the program andshould stay intact until the end of the program. All messages between neighboring nodes areexchanged over these connections.All nodes execute the following protocol:• Initially, each node in the system is either active or passive. At least one node must beactive at the beginning of the protocol.• While a node is active, it sends anywhere from minPerActive to maxPerActive messages, andthen turns passive. For each message, it makes a uniformly random selection of one of itsneighbors as the destination. Also, if the node stays active after sending a message, then itwaits for at least minSendDelay time units before sending the next message.• Only an active node can send a message.• A passive node, on receiving a message, becomes active if it has sent fewer than maxNumbermessages (summed over all active intervals). Otherwise, it stays passive.We refer to the protocol described above as the MAP protocol.1.2Part 2Implement the Chandy and Lamport’s protocol for recording a consistent global snapshot as dis-cussed in the class. Assume that the snapshot protocol is always initiated by node 0 and allchannels in the topology are bidirectional. Use the snapshot protocol to detect the termination ofthe MAP protocol described in Part 1. The MAP protocol terminates when all nodes are passiveand all channels are empty. To detect termination of the MAP protocol, augment the Chandyand Lamport’s snapshot protocol to collect the information recorded at each node at node 0 usinga converge-cast operation over a spanning tree. The tree can be built once in the beginning oron-the-fly for an instance using MARKER messages.Note that, in this project, the messages exchanged by the MAP protocol are application messagesand the messages exchanged by the snapshot protocol are control messages. The rules of the MAPprotocol (described in Part 1) only apply to application messages. They do not apply to controlmessages.Testing Correctness of the Snapshot Protocol ImplementationTo test that your implementation of the Chandy and Lamport’s snapshot protocol is correct,implement Fidge/Mattern’s vector clock protocol described in the class. The vector clock of a nodeis part of the local state of the node and its value is also recorded whenever a node records its localstate. Node 0, on receiving the information recorded by all the nodes, uses these vector timestampsto verify that the snapshot is indeed consistent. Note that only application messages will carryvector timestamps.1.3Part 3Once node 0 detects that the MAP protocol has terminated, it broadcasts a FINISH message toall processes. A process, on receiving a FINISH message, stops executing. Eventually, all processesstop executing and the entire system is brought to a halt.
